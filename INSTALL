Installation instructions
-------------------------

1) Prerequisites:
- Java JDK 6
- Apache ANT (tested with version 1.7.1)
- for non-Win32 users - download the swt.jar file for your platform and replace the current swt.jar in the "lib" subdir

Use a search engine of your choice to resolve the above dependencies.


2) Compilation:
Go to project root and write:

ant -Ddebug=off

If build is successful, write:

ant clean

After that, go to build/api subdir. The file "api.jar" is the archive needed to develop new algorithms.
The application is located in the build/gui subdir. Use gui.sh or gui.bat to run it, or simply run gui.jar (using java -jar gui.jar).
